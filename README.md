# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-With-Machine-Learning
In this project, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that created a model for recognizing handwritten digits given data from the MNIST dataset. With 3 convolutional layers and 2 pooling layers, the CNN is capable of determining what number between 0-9 a handwritten digit is with 99+% accuracy. To allow users to easily test their own handwritten digits against the model, I built a drawing interface that lets users simply draw with their cursor and ask the model to predict what digit they drew. The following libraries were implemented in the project: 
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* NumPy
* PIL
* SciPy V 1.1.0*
